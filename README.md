"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." - [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)
# l33t_h4x0r.exe
l33t_h4xor.exe is a repository that exists for the sole purpose of flooding my github "contributions" history
with many, MANY, delightful green boxes.

## Why l33t_h4xor.exe?
GitHub's "contribution history" section is easily and frequently spoofed. This is because recruiters
filter by the density of green boxes visible on a candidate's GitHub profile. Needless to say, this does not
afford them a good measure of ability.

## Message to Recruiters:
I am not free to open source my best projects.
To recruiters looking for a reliable measure of my programming skill and experience, email me at
gml@blackboxlabs.dev for a tour of my work that cannot be accessed from GitHub.
