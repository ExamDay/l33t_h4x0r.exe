l33t_h4xor.exe is a repository that exists for the sole purpose of flooding my GitHub contributions history
with many, MANY, delightful green boxes.

## Why l33t_h4xor.exe?
GitHub's "contribution history" section is easily and frequently spoofed. This is because recruiters
filter by the density of green boxes visible on a candidate's GitHub profile. Needless to say, this ceases to
afford them a good measure of ability when hackers like myself are aware of the practice. 

## Message to Recruiters:
Unfortunately, I am not free to open-source my best projects.
To recruiters looking for a reliable measure of my programming skill and experience, email me at
gml@blackboxlabs.dev. I am happy to provide tours of my work that cannot be made accessible on GitHub.
