l33t_h4xor.exe is a repository that exists for the sole purpose of flooding my GitHub contributions history
with many, MANY, delightful green boxes.

## Why l33t_h4xor.exe?
GitHub's contribution history section is easily and frequently spoofed. This is because recruiters
filter by the density of green boxes visible on a candidate's GitHub profile and it is trivial for any hacker
familiar with Git to establish their own commit history by ukase. Needless to say, this denies recruiters a
convenient measure of ability and puts non-hackers at a disadvantage, especially when both parties
are unaware of the practice. 

## Message to Recruiters:
Unfortunately, I am not free to open-source my best projects so the number of green boxes on my github
does not reflect my ability.
To recruiters looking for a reliable measure of my programming skill and experience, please email me at
watch.closely.0@gmail.com. I am happy to provide tours of my work that cannot be made accessible on GitHub.
